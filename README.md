INTRODUCTION

The Bato Bato Pick game is the Filipino version of the popular hand game, Rock, Paper, Scissors. It is played between two people and follows the same rules as the original game, but includes a distinct Filipino chant. 

The chant

The chant Bato, Bato, Pick! Is a rhythmic way for players to ensure they reveal their hand gestures at the same time. The word “pick” comes from English, signifying the final choice. In some parts of the Philippines, a different chant called “Jak-en-poy” (from the Japanese Jankenpon) is used. 

How to play

1.Players: Two people play against each other.

2.Hand Gestures: Players use the following hand gestures, which are based on the Tagalog words for each object:

  	Rock (Bato): A closed fist.
  
  	Paper (Papel): A flat, open hand.
  
  	Scissors (Gunting): A fist with the index and middle fingers extended.
  
3.The Countdown: To synchronize their actions, players typically chant, “Bato, Bato, Pick!”.

4.The Reveal: On the final word, “pick,” both players simultaneously reveal their chosen hand gesture.

5.Winning Rules: The winner is determined by the following hierarchy:

  	Paper beats rock.
  
  	Rock beats scissors.
  
  	Scissors beats paper.
  
6.Ties: If both players show the same gesture, it is a tie, and they play again.

7.Winning the Game: The game can be played for a single round or as a “best of three” to determine the overall winner. The person who wins the most rounds can win a prize or bragging rights.
